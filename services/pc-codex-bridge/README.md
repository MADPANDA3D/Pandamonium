# PC Codex Worker Bridge

This private bridge adapts Codex App Server tasks to the Odysseus worker protocol. It binds to localhost by default, accepts only server-mapped workspace aliases, persists Codex thread IDs, and emits replayable normalized events.

Supported artifact markers are limited to text documents inside the selected workspace:

```text
[[ODYSSEUS_ARTIFACT path="relative/path.md" title="Document title"]]
```

Odysseus validates and persists the artifact as a linked Document. The bridge never accepts arbitrary working directories from the model or caller.
